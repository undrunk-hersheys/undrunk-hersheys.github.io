Everything in here is about the camera basic.  

Here is the Exposure Triangle  
Aperture(f-number) | Shutterspeed | ISO  
  
Aperture  
When aperture is low(f/1.4), more lights come in, lighter the picture, blur background.  
When aperture is hight(f/16), less lights come in, darker the picture, clear background.  
  
Shutterspeed  
Shorter the shutterspeed(1/500), holds the movement, when taking wild animals, cat for e.g.  
Longer the shutterspeed(1/30), shows the trajectory of the stars or flow of the river for e.g.  
  
ISO  
Lower the ISO, less sensitive to lights, lesser noise with clear photo.  
Higher the ISO, high sensitive to lights, more noise but brighter photo.
